            <article>
                When Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) is 21, his father (Bill Nighy) tells him a secret: The men in their family can travel through time. 
                Although he can't change history, Tim resolves to improve his life by getting a girlfriend. 
                He meets Mary (Rachel McAdams), falls in love and finally wins her heart via time-travel and a little cunning. 
                However, as his unusual life progresses, Tim finds that his special ability can't shield him and those he loves from the problems of ordinary life.
